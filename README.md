What is it?
===========

A puppet module that installs artifactory and manages the service.
Configuration of artifactory is mainly done through the app.  A define is
also provided that will fetch artifacts from the repository aideing in
application deployments.

Note: Java is required for this module but I didn't add it to the Modulefile
as a dependency since there are so many indivudalized java deployments.

Backups are done through the backup rubygem.


Usage:
------

Generic artifactory install
<pre>
  class { 'artifactory':
    serverAlias => [ 'artifactory', 'artifactory.mycompany.com' ]
  }
</pre>

Fetching an artifact:
<pre>
  artifactory::fetch_artifact { 'mywar':
    project       => 'myproject',
    version       => '1.2.3',
    format        => 'war',
    install_path  => '/data/tomcat/site',
    filename      => 'myproject-1.2.3-war'
  }
</pre>
This will fetch a war of version 1.2.3 of myproject and store it as
/data/tomcat/site/myproject-1.2.3-war.
